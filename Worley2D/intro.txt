key idea:
random feature points' positions
translate the distance between current pixel to feature point into the grey value

problems:
when the point counts increases, program will slow down

optimization:
using grid to generate feature pionts in itself
checking the feature points from the grid current pixel in and caculate the shortest distance, or neighbor grids;
