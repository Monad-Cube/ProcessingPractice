key idea:
calculate the position from the theta between line and plumb line, using theta velocity and theta acceleration to replace the traditional velocity and acceleration.

coding analysis:
use a pgraphics to matain the ball's motion curve, and meanwhile doesn't keep the pendulum's body's motion shadow.

special mention:
you need to pay attention the x1,y1's calculation, using cosine or sine, and the order of calculating, drawing and updating data.
