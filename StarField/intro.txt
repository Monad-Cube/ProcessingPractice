keyidea:

not use the 3D coordinate, just move the point or line from center to the border to simulate the 3D movement.

1. translate the center's position to the screen center,
2. change the z position while looping 
3. caculate the ratio of x positon to z position, and map it to the range which is from 0 to width or height if it is from 0 to 1, map it to the range which is from negative width or height to 0 if it is from -1 to 0;.
4. when the space key is pressed, center's position is detemined by mouseX and mouseY.
